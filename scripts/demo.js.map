If a work-in-progress render is discarded before\n// finishing, we create a new work-in-progress by cloning the current queue.\n//\n// Both queues share a persistent, singly-linked list structure. To schedule an\n// update, we append it to the end of both queues. Each queue maintains a\n// pointer to first update in the persistent list that hasn't been processed.\n// The work-in-progress pointer always has a position equal to or greater than\n// the current queue, since we always work on that one. The current queue's\n// pointer is only updated during the commit phase, when we swap in the\n// work-in-progress.\n//\n// For example:\n//\n//   Current pointer:           A - B - C - D - E - F\n//   Work-in-progress pointer:              D - E - F\n//                                          ^\n//                                          The work-in-progress queue has\n//                                          processed more updates than current.\n//\n// The reason we append to both queues is because otherwise we might drop\n// updates without ever processing them. For example, if we only add updates to\n// the work-in-progress queue, some updates could be lost whenever a work-in\n// -progress render restarts by cloning from current. Similarly, if we only add\n// updates to the current queue, the updates will be lost whenever an already\n// in-progress queue commits and swaps with the current queue. However, by\n// adding to both queues, we guarantee that the update will be part of the next\n// work-in-progress. (And because the work-in-progress queue becomes the\n// current queue once it commits, there's no danger of applying the same\n// update twice.)\n//\n// Prioritization\n// --------------\n//\n// Updates are not sorted by priority, but by insertion; new updates are always\n// appended to the end of the list.\n//\n// The priority is still important, though. When processing the update queue\n// during the render phase, only the updates with sufficient priority are\n// included in the result. If we skip an update because it has insufficient\n// priority, it remains in the queue to be processed later, during a lower\n// priority render. Crucially, all updates subsequent to a skipped update also\n// remain in the queue *regardless of their priority*. That means high priority\n// updates are sometimes processed twice, at two separate priorities. We also\n// keep track of a base state, that represents the state before the first\n// update in the queue is applied.\n//\n// For example:\n//\n//   Given a base state of '', and the following queue of updates\n//\n//     A1 - B2 - C1 - D2\n//\n//   where the number indicates the priority, and the update is applied to the\n//   previous state by appending a letter, React will process these updates as\n//   two separate renders, one per distinct priority level:\n//\n//   First render, at priority 1:\n//     Base state: ''\n//     Updates: [A1, C1]\n//     Result state: 'AC'\n//\n//   Second render, at priority 2:\n//     Base state: 'A'            <-  The base state does not include C1,\n//                                    because B2 was skipped.\n//     Updates: [B2, C1, D2]      <-  C1 was rebased on top of B2\n//     Result state: 'ABCD'\n//\n// Because we process updates in insertion order, and rebase high priority\n// updates when preceding updates are skipped, the final result is deterministic\n// regardless of priority.
