// We are using a tag type to mark a content model type as mutable.

// This is generally a workaround to https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/13347

// In order to know if a block has been changed, we want to mark all blocks, blocks groups, segments and their members as readonly,
// When we want to change a block/segment/block group, we need to call a function to convert it to mutable. Inside this function
// we can make some change to the object (e.g. remove cached element if any) so later we know this object is changed.
// So that we expect there is a build time error if we assign a readonly object to a function that accepts mutable object only.
// However this does not happen today.

// To workaround it, we manually add a hidden member (dummy) to all mutable types, and add another member with readonly array type to
// readonly types. When we assign readonly object to mutable one, compiler will fail to build since the two arrays are not matching.
// So that we can know where to fix from build time. And since the dummy value is optional, it won't break existing creator code.

// @example
// let readonly: ReadonlyMark = {};
// let mutable: MutableMark = {};

// readonly = mutable; // OK
// mutable = readonly; // Error: Type 'ReadonlyMark' is not assignable to type 'MutableMark'.
