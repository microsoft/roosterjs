     * If there is any entity in editor, the returned object will contain cloned copy of entity wrapper element.
     * If editor is in dark mode, the cloned entity will be converted back to light mode.
     * - reduced: Returns a reduced Content Model that only contains the model of current selection. If there is already a up-to-date cached model, use it
     * instead to improve performance. This is mostly used for retrieve current format state.
     * - clean: Similar with disconnected, this will return a disconnected model, the difference is "clean" mode will not include any selection info.
