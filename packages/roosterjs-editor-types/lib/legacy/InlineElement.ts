 * This refers to an inline element (as opposed to block) in editor
 * Inline and block makes the "type" system in editor.
 * An inline element is a maximum resolvable "entity" within the boundary of a block
 * At minimum and also most commonly, it represents a text node.
 * It can represent broader "content" depending on the resolvers that are available, i.e.
 * it can be anchor link, image, emoji, ...
 * Two rules:
 * 1) every inline element must have a container node (text or span, a etc.)
 * 2) inline element cannot be nested
