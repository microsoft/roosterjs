/**
 * Represents a DOM region.
 * A region is a range under a given node, and possibly after one child and before another child
 * e.g.
 * ```html
 * <div>
 *   <table>...</table>
 *   <span>...</span>
 *   <span>...</span>
 *   <table>...</table>
 * <div>
 * ```
 * We can define a region under DIV before the second TABLE and after the first TABLE
 *
 * This is used when user's selection go across different TD elements or start from TD and end after
 * that TD (or inverse way). Some block operation should not ruin the TABLE structure, so we need to
 * split the selection into several regions.
