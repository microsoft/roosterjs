Move nodes directly under OL/UL into a LI node, unless it is an orphan node\n        // Please see comment for VListItem.isOrphanItem() for more information about orphan node\n        // e.g.:\n        // ```HTML\n        // <ol>\n        //   <li>item 1</li>\n        //   <div>item 2</div>\n        // </ol>\n        // ```\n        // After this step, it should become:\n        // ```html\n        // <ol>\n        //   <li>item 1\n        //     <div>item 2</div>\n        //   <li>\n        // </ol>\n        // ```\n        moveChildNodesToLi(this.rootList);\n        queryElements(this.rootList, 'ol,ul', moveChildNodesToLi);\n\n        // 2. Move LI node embeded into another LI node out to directly under OL/UL node\n        // Ideally browser we do this for us automatically when out the HTML into DOM. However after\n        // step 1, it is possible that we move some LI node into another one. e.g:\n        // ```HTML\n        // <ol>\n        //   <li>item 1</li>\n        //   <div>\n        //     item 1.1\n        //     <li>item 3</li>\n        //   </div>\n        // </ol>\n        // ```\n        // See that the second LI tag is not directly under OL, so after step 1, this will become:\n        // ```html\n        // <ol>\n        //   <li>item 1\n        //     <div>\n        //       item 1.1\n        //       <li>item 2</li>\n        //     </div>\n        //   <li>\n        // </ol>\n        // ```\n        // Now we have a LI tag embeded into another LI tag. So we need step 2 to move the inner LI tag out to be:\n        // ```html\n        // <ol>\n        //   <li>item1\n        //     <div>item 1.1</div>\n        //   </li>\n        //   <li><div>item2</div></li>\n        // </ol>\n        // ```\n        queryElements(this.rootList, 'li', moveLiToList);\n\n        this.populateItems(this.rootList);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Check if this list contains the given node\n     * @param node The node to check\n     */\n    contains(node: Node) {\n        // We don't check if the node is contained by this.rootList here, because after some operation,\n        // it is possible a node is logically contained by this list but the container list item hasn't\n        // been put under this.rootList in DOM tree yet.\n        return this.items.some(item => item.contains(node));\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Get list number of the last item in this VList.\n     * If there is no order list item, result will be undefined\n     */\n    getLastItemNumber(): number | undefined {\n        const start = getStart(this.rootList);\n\n        return start === undefined\n            ? start\n            : start -\n                  1 +\n                  this.items.filter(\n                      item => item.getListType() == ListType.Ordered && item.getLevel() == 1\n                  ).length;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Write the result back into DOM tree\n     * After that, this VList becomes unavailable because we set this.rootList to null\n     */\n    writeBack() {\n        if (!this.rootList) {\n            throw new Error('rootList must not be null');\n        }\n\n        const doc = this.rootList.ownerDocument;\n        const listStack: Node[] = [doc.createDocumentFragment()];\n        const placeholder = doc.createTextNode('');\n        let start = getStart(this.rootList) || 1;\n        let lastList: Node;\n\n        // Use a placeholder to hold the position since the root list may be moved into document fragment later\n        this.rootList.parentNode.replaceChild(placeholder, this.rootList);\n\n        this.items.forEach(item => {\n            item.writeBack(listStack, this.rootList);\n            const topList = listStack[1];\n\n            if (safeInstanceOf(topList, 'HTMLOListElement')) {\n                if (lastList != topList) {\n                    if (start == 1) {\n                        topList.removeAttribute('start');\n                    } else {\n                        topList.start = start;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                if (item.getLevel() == 1) {\n                    start++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            lastList = topList;\n        });\n\n        // Restore the content to the positioni of placeholder\n        placeholder.parentNode.replaceChild(listStack[0], placeholder);\n\n        // Set rootList to null to avoid this to be called again for the same VList, because\n        // after change the rootList may not be available any more (e.g. outdent all items).\n        this.rootList = null;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Set indentation of the given range of this list\n     * @param start Start position to operate from\n     * @param end End positon to operate to\n     * @param indentation Indent or outdent\n     */\n    setIndentation(start: NodePosition, end: NodePosition, indentation: Indentation) {\n        this.findListItems(start, end, item =>\n            indentation == Indentation.Decrease ? item.outdent() : item.indent()\n        );\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Change list type of the given range of this list.\n     * If some of the items are not real list item yet, this will make them to be list item with given type\n     * If all items in the given range are already in the type to change to, this becomes an outdent operation\n     * @param start Start position to operate from\n     * @param end End position to operate to\n     * @param targetType Target list type\n     */\n    changeListType(start: NodePosition, end: NodePosition, targetType: ListType) {\n        let needChangeType = false;\n\n        this.findListItems(start, end, item => {\n            needChangeType = needChangeType || item.getListType() != targetType;\n        });\n        this.findListItems(start, end, item =>\n            needChangeType ? item.changeListType(targetType) : item.outdent()\n        );\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Append a new item to this VList\n     * @param node node of the item to append.
