Move LI node embeded into another LI node out to directly under OL/UL node\n        // Ideally browser we do this for us automatically when out the HTML into DOM. However after\n        // step 1, it is possible that we move some LI node into another one. e.g:\n        // ```HTML\n        // <ol>\n        //   <li>item 1</li>\n        //   <div>\n        //     item 1.1\n        //     <li>item 3</li>\n        //   </div>\n        // </ol>\n        // ```\n        // See that the second LI tag is not directly under OL, so after step 1, this will become:\n        // ```html\n        // <ol>\n        //   <li>item 1\n        //     <div>\n        //       item 1.1\n        //       <li>item 2</li>\n        //     </div>\n        //   <li>\n        // </ol>\n        // ```\n        // Now we have a LI tag embeded into another LI tag. So we need step 2 to move the inner LI tag out to be:\n        // ```html\n        // <ol>\n        //   <li>item1\n        //     <div>item 1.1</div>\n        //   </li>\n        //   <li><div>item2</div></li>\n        // </ol>\n        // ```\n        queryElements(this.rootList, 'li', moveLiToList);\n\n        this.populateItems(this.rootList);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Check if this list contains the given node\n     * @param node The node to check\n     */\n    contains(node: Node) {\n        // We don't check if the node is contained by this.rootList here, because after some operation,\n        // it is possible a node is logically contained by this list but the container list item hasn't\n        // been put under this.rootList in DOM tree yet.\n        return this.items.some(item => item.contains(node));\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Get list number of the last item in this VList.\n     * If there is no order list item, result will be undefined\n     */\n    getLastItemNumber(): number | undefined {\n        const start = getStart(this.rootList);\n\n        return start === undefined\n            ?
