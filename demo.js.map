For a merged/splitted table cell, it will has colSpan/rowSpan value. We also created TableCell model for those spanned\n * cells, and use \"spanLeft\" and \"spanAbove\" to mark its state\n * 4. When edit table, we always edit on this mapped m * n array because it always has an item for each cell\n * 5.
