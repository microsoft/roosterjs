For a merged/splitted table cell, it will has colSpan/rowSpan value. We also created TableCell model for those spanned\n * cells, and use \"spanLeft\" and \"spanAbove\" to mark its state\n * 4. When edit table, we always edit on this mapped m * n array because it always has an item for each cell\n * 5. When write back to DOM, we create TD/TH elements for those non-spanned cells, and mark its colSpan/rowSpan value according\n * its neighbour cell's spanLeft/spanAbove attribute\n */\nexport const tableProcessor: ElementProcessor<HTMLTableElement> = (\n    group,\n    tableElement,\n    context\n) => {\n    stackFormat(\n        context,\n        { segment: 'shallowCloneForBlock', paragraph: 'shallowCloneForGroup' },\n        () => {\n            parseFormat(tableElement, context.formatParsers.block, context.blockFormat, context);\n\n            const table = createTable(tableElement.rows.length, context.blockFormat);\n            const { table: selectedTable, firstCell, lastCell } = context.tableSelection || {};\n            const hasTableSelection = selectedTable == tableElement && !!firstCell && !!lastCell;\n\n            if (context.allowCacheElement) {\n                table.cachedElement = tableElement;\n            }\n\n            parseFormat(tableElement, context.formatParsers.table, table.format, context);\n            parseFormat(tableElement, context.formatParsers.tableBorder, table.format, context);\n            parseFormat(\n                tableElement,\n                context.formatParsers.segmentOnBlock,\n                context.segmentFormat,\n                context\n            );\n            parseFormat(tableElement, context.formatParsers.dataset, table.dataset, context);\n            addBlock(group, table);\n\n            const columnPositions: number[] = [0];\n            const rowPositions: number[] = [0];\n            const zoomScale = context.zoomScaleFormat.zoomScale || 1;\n\n            for (let row = 0;
